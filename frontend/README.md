### Fast way to view frontend project 

![2021-05-13_23-18-51](https://minio.llycloud.com/image/uPic/image-20210614Ak0OE2.png)

directly run `http-server` in `dist` folder (we have built it for you) or `serve -l 8081` 

`/home/ubuntu/wdc/COVID_contact_tracing_system/frontend/dist`

**Important : Due to the limitations that http-server command can not directly display url root, we would strongly recommend you to use `serve -l 8081` command to avoid unpredictable issues**
